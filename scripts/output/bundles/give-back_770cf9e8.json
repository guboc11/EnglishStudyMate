    "story": "When Maya moved to a new city for her first job, a coworker named James lent her his spare bicycle so she could get around. She relied on it every day for three months, riding to work, the grocery store, and weekend markets. Once she finally saved enough to buy her own bike, she cleaned James's bicycle until it sparkled and rode it to the office one last time.

That small gesture reminded them both that borrowing and returning things with care strengthens any friendship.",
