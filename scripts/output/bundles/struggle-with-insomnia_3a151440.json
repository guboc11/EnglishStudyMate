She would climb into bed at ten, only to find herself wide awake at two in the morning, heart pounding with unnamed anxiety. She tried herbal teas, white noise apps, and even a weighted blanket, but nothing seemed to quiet her restless mind.

Reluctantly, Jenna began therapy and started setting firm boundaries between her work hours and personal time. Slowly, sleep began to return to her, one peaceful night at a time.",
