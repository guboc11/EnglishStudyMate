    "story": "Jenna had only been at the consulting firm for six months when she was assigned to lead the Henderson account — a client notorious for being impossible to please. She spent weeks studying their pain points, rebuilding the proposal from scratch, and rehearsing her presentation until every detail was sharp. On the day of the pitch, the client's CEO leaned back in his chair and said he'd never seen such thorough work.
