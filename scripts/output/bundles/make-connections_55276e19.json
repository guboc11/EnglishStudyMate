    "story": "Marcus had always been the quiet one at work, content to keep his head down and let his code speak for itself. But after being passed over for a promotion, his manager pulled him aside and told him he needed to make connections across teams, not just within his own. Reluctantly, he started joining the weekly all-hands lunches and chatting with people from marketing, product, and design. Slowly, he realized these weren't just social rituals — they were how ideas actually moved through the company. Within a few months, he was being invited into rooms he never knew existed. He still let his code do the talking, but now people knew who was behind it.",

  "meaning": {
    "literalMeaningKo": "사람들 사이에 연결 고리를 만들다, 즉 관계나 인맥을 형성하다.",
    "realUsageKo": "주로 직업적·사회적 맥락에서 새로운 사람들과 관계를 맺고 네트워크를 구축하는 행위를 가리킬 때 사용한다. 단순히 아는 사이가 되는 것을 넘어, 나중에 도움이 될 수 있는 의미 있는 인연을 만든다는 뉘앙스가 강하다.",
    "etymologyKo": "'connection'은 라틴어 'connectere(함께 묶다)'에서 유래했다. 'make'와 결합해 능동적으로 관계를 '만들어낸다'는 의미를 강조한다.",
    "nuanceKo": "단순한 만남(meet people)보다 목적의식이 느껴지며, 'build connections'와 비슷하지만 'make'는 첫 연결 고리를 만드는 순간에 더 집중하는 뉘앙스가 있다. 격식체와 비격식체 모두에서 자연스럽게 쓰인다.",
