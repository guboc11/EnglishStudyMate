    "story": "James had never expected to look after his elderly grandmother full-time. When she was diagnosed with early-stage dementia, his parents were overseas and couldn't return immediately. So James moved into her small apartment near the river, learning to cook her favorite dishes and keeping her company during the long evenings. Some days were harder than others — she would forget his name or wander toward the front door at midnight. But every morning, when she smiled at him over breakfast and said, \"You're such a good boy,\" he knew he was exactly where he needed to be.",
