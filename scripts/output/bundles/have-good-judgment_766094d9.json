    "story": "Elena had spent years working in crisis management, and over time she had developed an almost instinctive ability to read situations quickly. Her colleagues often said she seemed to have good judgment no matter how chaotic things got. One evening, during a product launch that was going sideways, she quietly stepped in and redirected the team with a single clear recommendation.
