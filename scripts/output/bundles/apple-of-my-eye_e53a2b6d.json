    "story": "Grandpa Hwan always said his granddaughter Mina was the apple of his eye. Every Saturday morning, he would wake up early to make her favorite banana pancakes before she arrived. He kept every drawing she had ever made pinned to the wall of his small workshop. When Mina started school and visited less often, he would sit by the window, waiting for her bicycle to appear around the corner. One rainy afternoon, Mina surprised him with a hand-painted portrait of the two of them eating pancakes together. Grandpa Hwan hung it in the center of the wall and told everyone who visited that his greatest treasure wasn't anything money could buy.",
