    "story": "After three days of drafting, Mia finally had a product launch strategy she was proud of. Before sending it to the executive team, she wanted a second pair of eyes on it and asked if she could run the plan by her mentor. Her mentor listened carefully, asked probing questions, and pointed out an assumption about market timing that hadn't been tested. Mia went back to her desk, revised the section, and strengthened her argument with data she had overlooked. When she finally presented to the executives, her confidence showed. She had learned that running an idea by someone you trust before a big reveal almost always makes it sharper.",
