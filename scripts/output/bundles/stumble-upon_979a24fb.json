    "story": "Maya had been wandering through the narrow backstreets of Lisbon with no particular destination in mind when she stumbled upon a tiny courtyard hidden behind an unmarked wooden door.

It became the highlight of her entire trip — not something she had planned, but something she would never forget. Sometimes the best moments are the ones you stumble upon.",
