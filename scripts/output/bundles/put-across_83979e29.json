    "story": "Elena had been researching climate solutions for years, but every time she presented her findings, people's eyes seemed to glaze over. She realized that knowing the facts was not enough — she needed to put across the urgency in a way that truly resonated. She rewrote her entire presentation, replacing dense statistics with personal stories and vivid comparisons.
