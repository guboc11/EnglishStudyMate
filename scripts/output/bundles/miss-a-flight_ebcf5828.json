    "story": "Kevin had been looking forward to his vacation in Barcelona for months. The night before his departure, he stayed up late double-checking his packing list and watching travel videos. Unfortunately, he forgot to set his alarm and woke up two hours before his flight. The highway was jammed with morning traffic, and every red light felt like an eternity. By the time he sprinted through the terminal, the boarding gate had already closed — he had missed his flight. He slumped into a plastic chair, staring at the departure board, wondering how something he had planned so carefully could go so wrong.",
