    "story": "Marcus had spent fifteen years in finance treating every deal as a zero sum game — if he won, someone else had to lose, and that was exactly how he liked it. He built a reputation for ruthless negotiation, squeezing every concession out of counterparts and leaving little goodwill behind. But when his firm lost a major client to a smaller competitor known for collaborative partnerships, his boss asked him to figure out why. Researching the rival firm, Marcus was struck by how they structured deals so both sides walked away feeling they had gained something. He began to realize that the zero sum game mentality had been costing him opportunities he never even knew existed. Slowly and reluctantly, he started approaching negotiations differently — and was surprised to find that expanding the pie together often left him with a larger slice than before.",
