    "story": "Jake had been avoiding his overflowing email inbox for weeks, and it was starting to cause real problems at work. Important client messages were getting lost among hundreds of newsletters and spam. One rainy Sunday afternoon, he made himself a strong coffee and sat down to sort out the chaos. He created folders, set up filters, and replied to every urgent message he had missed. It took him nearly four hours, but when he finally closed his laptop, his inbox was down to zero. He promised himself he would never let things pile up like that again.",
