Technical debt had grown to the point where adding new features required navigating around so many legacy constraints that progress had nearly stalled. The engineering team proposed starting fresh — not abandoning existing functionality, but rebuilding the architecture cleanly from current requirements rather than historical ones. The rewrite took eight months. The resulting system was faster, cleaner, and the team's velocity on new features doubled. Starting fresh had been the most conservative decision available.",
