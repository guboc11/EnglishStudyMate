    "story": "When Mia joined the small marketing agency fresh out of college, she had the skills but none of the real-world experience. Her supervisor, Daniel, could see her potential and decided to personally show her the ropes over the first two weeks. He brought her into client meetings, explained how to handle difficult feedback, and taught her the unwritten rules of the office. Mia soaked everything up like a sponge, asking questions and taking careful notes. By the end of her first month, she was handling her own accounts with minimal guidance. She never forgot how much Daniel's patience had meant to her, and years later she made a point of showing the ropes to every new hire who walked through the door.",
