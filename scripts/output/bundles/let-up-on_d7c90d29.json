    "story": "For the first three months of the school year, Ms. Harmon was known as the strictest teacher in the building. She assigned extra reading every weekend and collected homework at the start of each class without exception. Students whispered that she never smiled and never let up on anyone who fell behind. But after the winter break, something shifted. She had spent the holidays watching her own children struggle under the pressure of competitive sports coaches, and she understood, for the first time, how crushing relentless expectations could feel. When she returned in January, she began to let up on the late submissions policy and offered office hours for students who needed more time. The class didn't become easier, but it became more human.",

    "etymologyKo": "'let up'은 19세기부터 '완화되다, 줄어들다'의 뜻으로 쓰였으며, 여기에 대상을 가리키는 전치사 'on'이 결합하여 특정 대상에 대한 압박을 줄인다는 의미가 형성되었다.",
