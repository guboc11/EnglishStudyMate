    "story": "From the moment he joined the research lab, Dr. Chen made it clear he was there to push boundaries. His colleagues were skeptical when he proposed merging two fields that had never been combined before. Late nights and failed experiments piled up, but he refused to retreat to safer ground. Slowly, the data began to confirm what he had always believed was possible.
