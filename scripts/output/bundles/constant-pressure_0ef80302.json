    "story": "The study examined how different industries managed constant pressure on their workforces. What distinguished the high-performing, low-burnout organizations was not the absence of pressure — the pressure was inherent to the work — but the distribution of control. Teams who had autonomy over how and when they addressed demands reported significantly lower burnout than those who experienced the same volume of demands but had no agency over their response. Constant pressure was less damaging when it came with the ability to shape one's own response to it.",
