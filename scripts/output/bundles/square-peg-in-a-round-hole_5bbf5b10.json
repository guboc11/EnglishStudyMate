    "story": "Daniel had always been the creative type, so when his parents pushed him into medicine, he knew deep down he was a square peg in a round hole. He spent years memorizing anatomy charts while secretly filling notebooks with short stories and poetry. His professors praised his intelligence but noticed he never quite seemed present in lectures.
