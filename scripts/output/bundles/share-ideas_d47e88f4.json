The result was that people who would never have spoken up in a corporate meeting shared ideas freely and visibly, and the best ones rose through the system on merit. The lesson for conventional organizations was not that hierarchy was wrong but that sharing ideas required psychological safety that hierarchy often inadvertently suppressed.",
