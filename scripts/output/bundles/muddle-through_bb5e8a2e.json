    "story": "When the project manager quit without warning two weeks before the product launch, the team was left scrambling. No one had the full picture of what still needed to be done, and panic spread quickly through the office. But instead of giving up, they gathered around a whiteboard, divided up the remaining tasks, and decided to muddle through together. The next two weeks were chaotic — late nights, unexpected bugs, and last-minute design changes — but the team kept pushing. On launch day, the product went live with only minor hiccups, and the exhausted team stood proud. Sometimes, the willingness to muddle through is all it takes to cross the finish line.",
