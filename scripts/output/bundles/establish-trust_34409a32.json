    "story": "When Daniel took over as the new manager, the team was still recovering from the chaos left by his predecessor. He knew that before anything else, he needed to establish trust. He started by holding one-on-one meetings with each team member, listening carefully without interrupting or judging. He followed through on every commitment he made, no matter how small, and was the first to admit when he was wrong. Slowly, the atmosphere in the office shifted — people began to speak more freely in meetings and support one another. By the end of the quarter, the team's performance had improved dramatically, built on a foundation of genuine trust.",
