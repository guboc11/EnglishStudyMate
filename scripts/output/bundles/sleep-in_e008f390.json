    "story": "Jake had been setting his alarm for 5:30 AM every single day for three months straight. His startup was launching soon, and there was always something urgent to fix. But when the product finally went live and the first wave of positive reviews came in, his co-founder sent a simple message: 'Take tomorrow off.' For the first time in what felt like forever, Jake got to sleep in without a shred of guilt. He didn't roll out of bed until almost eleven, shuffling to the kitchen in his pajamas with a lazy grin. That slow, quiet morning reminded him why he had been working so hard in the first place.",
