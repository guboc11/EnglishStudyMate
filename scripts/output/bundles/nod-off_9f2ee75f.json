After a massive home-cooked meal, everyone would settle into the living room while she put on an old black-and-white movie. Within fifteen minutes, Uncle David would nod off in the recliner, his newspaper still clutched in his hands. The kids would giggle and place crackers on his chest to see how many they could stack before he woke up. Grandma would smile from her chair, pretending not to notice. It was one of those small, silly traditions that made every visit feel like home.",
