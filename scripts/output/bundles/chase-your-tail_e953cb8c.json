    "story": "For weeks, the marketing team had been chasing their tail trying to figure out why their campaign numbers kept dropping.

Their manager finally called in a consultant who reviewed the data and pointed out that they had been targeting the wrong demographic from the very start. All the micro-adjustments had been pointless — they had simply been chasing their tail while the core problem went unaddressed. Once they redirected their efforts toward the right audience, the numbers climbed steadily within a week.",
