    "story": "The training program had been designed by a consultant who had interviewed managers but not frontline staff. When it launched, attendance was high because it was mandatory. Engagement was not. The activities were aimed at skills the participants already had; the real challenges they faced daily were never addressed. The program missed the mark by solving for what looked like the problem rather than what was actually the problem. Feedback was collected at the end, and for the first time, management read all of it. The next version was designed in collaboration with the people it was meant to serve.",
