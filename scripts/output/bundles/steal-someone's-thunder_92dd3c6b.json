She did not react visibly. She said the suggestion was interesting and she would look into it. What she did not say was that seeing a new hire arrive at the same solution independently validated the idea in a way she had not expected. She featured the suggestion in her presentation anyway, named him by name, and let the credit land where it belonged. Stealing thunder, she had learned, was less effective than sharing the stage.",
