    "story": "Mina had just started her new job at a marketing agency, and her manager assigned her a client report on her very first day. The spreadsheet was dense with numbers she barely understood, and she felt completely overwhelmed. She stayed an extra hour after everyone left, cross-checking figures and formatting charts one by one. When she finally managed to complete a task that seemed impossible just hours earlier, she leaned back in her chair and exhaled. Her manager walked by, glanced at the screen, and gave her a small nod of approval. It was a tiny victory, but it made her feel like she truly belonged there.",

  "meaning": {
    "literalMeaningKo": "주어진 과제나 업무를 끝까지 마무리하다라는 뜻입니다.",
    "realUsageKo": "직장, 학교, 일상에서 맡은 일을 성공적으로 끝냈을 때 폭넓게 사용됩니다. 'finish a task'보다 좀 더 격식 있고, 모든 요구사항을 충족시켜 마무리했다는 뉘앙스가 있습니다.",
    "etymologyKo": "'complete'는 라틴어 'completus(채워진, 완성된)'에서 유래했으며, 'task'는 중세 영어에서 '부과된 일'을 뜻하는 단어에서 왔습니다. 두 단어가 결합해 '주어진 일을 빠짐없이 완수하다'라는 의미를 형성합니다.",
    "nuanceKo": "'finish a task'가 단순히 끝냈다는 의미라면, 'complete a task'는 요구된 기준을 충족하며 제대로 마무리했다는 느낌을 줍니다. 업무 보고나 공식적인 상황에서 더 자주 쓰입니다.",
