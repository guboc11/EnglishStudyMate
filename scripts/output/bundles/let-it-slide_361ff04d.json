    "story": "It had been a long week at the office, and tensions were running high on the team. During the Friday debrief, Mark interrupted Claire three times while she was presenting her data—something that would normally drive her up the wall. But Claire took a breath and decided to let it slide, reminding herself that Mark was also under enormous pressure. After the meeting, she quietly pulled him aside and mentioned it calmly, choosing conversation over confrontation. By letting the small slight go in the moment, she preserved the working relationship and kept the team's morale intact.",
