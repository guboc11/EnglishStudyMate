    "story": "James had spent three years building his startup, pouring every spare hour into the product he believed in. When a major investor pulled out and a key engineer resigned in the same week, James began to experience setbacks that felt impossible to recover from. He sat alone in his office that Friday evening, staring at a blank spreadsheet, wondering if he had made a terrible mistake. But by Sunday morning, he had called his remaining team together and reframed the situation as a chance to rebuild smarter. They stripped the product down to its core, found a smaller but loyal customer base, and moved forward one careful step at a time. James later said that learning to experience setbacks without losing his sense of direction was the most valuable lesson his startup ever taught him.",
