    "story": "Maya had been quietly fixing bugs and optimizing the codebase for months while her manager, Dylan, presented the results to upper management as if they were his own achievements. One day, the VP of Engineering visited the team and asked who was behind the impressive performance improvements. Dylan hesitated, but a senior colleague spoke up and said it was all Maya's work. The VP turned to Dylan and said, \"You need to give credit where it's due — that's what real leadership looks like.\" Dylan's face turned red, and he mumbled an apology. From that day on, Maya made sure to document her contributions, and the team adopted a practice of publicly acknowledging each person's role in every project review.",
