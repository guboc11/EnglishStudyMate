    "story": "Marcus had been a software engineer for fifteen years, but he had never spoken in front of a crowd. When his old college asked him to give a lecture about career transitions in tech, his first instinct was to say no. He practiced in front of his bathroom mirror every night for two weeks, timing each section with a stopwatch. On the day of the lecture, his hands trembled as he walked to the podium, but the moment he saw the curious faces in the audience, something clicked.
