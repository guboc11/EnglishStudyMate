She could not immediately say why — the technique was not the most polished, the subject matter was familiar. But something in the composition caught her eye in a way that made her set it aside and return to it three times before the end of the session. It was selected. When she met the artist and described the experience, the artist said the piece had taken six months of reworking. Whatever had made the curator stop was the sixth version of a first idea.",
