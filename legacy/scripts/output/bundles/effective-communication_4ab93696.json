The program designer revised the approach entirely: instead of workshops on principles, the new format used real situations from participants' actual work, had managers practice specific feedback conversations rather than learn frameworks, and built in peer observation and reflection cycles. The behavioral transfer rates doubled within six months. Effective communication, it turned out, was a practice, not a concept.",
