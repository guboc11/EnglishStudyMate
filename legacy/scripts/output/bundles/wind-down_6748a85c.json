    "story": "Sophie had promised herself she would stop bringing work home, but tonight was different — a product launch had gone sideways. She dropped her bag by the door and kicked off her shoes. The apartment was dark and still. She lit a candle, ran a warm bath, and put on her favorite jazz playlist. As she sank into the water, she finally began to wind down.

    "literalMeaningKo": "'wind'(감다)와 'down'(아래로)이 합쳐져, 태엽이 풀리듯 서서히 느슨해진다는 뜻입니다.",
    "realUsageKo": "바쁜 일과나 긴장된 상황이 끝난 뒤 몸과 마음을 편하게 이완시킬 때 사용합니다. 예를 들어 퇴근 후 휴식을 취하거나 잠자리에 들기 전 긴장을 풀 때 자주 씁니다.",
    "etymologyKo": "시계나 태엽 장치를 감는 'wind up'의 반대 개념에서 유래했습니다. 태엽이 풀리면 장치가 천천히 멈추듯, 활동이나 긴장이 서서히 줄어드는 것을 비유합니다.",
    "nuanceKo": "격식 없는 일상 대화에서 자주 쓰이며, 긍정적이고 편안한 뉘앙스를 갖습니다. 'relax'보다 '서서히 이완되는 과정'을 강조합니다.",
