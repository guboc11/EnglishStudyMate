    "story": "When Priya was laid off, she saw it not as a setback but as a rare chance to work toward a goal she had shelved for years — becoming a software engineer. She enrolled in an online bootcamp, dedicating her evenings and weekends to learning despite the frustration of debugging code late into the night. Her friends marveled at her discipline, but Priya knew that every small win — a solved problem, a completed project — was proof she was moving in the right direction. Months passed, and her portfolio slowly filled with real applications she had built from scratch. When a tech startup finally offered her a junior developer role, she remembered the day she had chosen to chase the dream instead of playing it safe. Working toward a goal, she realized, was less about speed and more about refusing to stop.",
