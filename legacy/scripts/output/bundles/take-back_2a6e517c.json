    "story": "Mia had been furious when she found out her roommate had borrowed her favorite jacket without asking. She stormed into the kitchen and said things she didn't really mean — calling her roommate selfish and inconsiderate. But later that evening, sitting alone in her room, guilt crept in. She realized her reaction had been way too extreme over a jacket. The next morning, Mia knocked on her roommate's door and said quietly, \"I want to take back what I said yesterday. I was angry, but none of those words were fair.\" Her roommate smiled and handed the jacket back, and they both laughed it off over coffee.",

  "meaning": {
    "literalMeaningKo": "'뒤로 가져가다'라는 뜻으로, 말이나 물건을 원래 상태로 되돌리는 것을 의미합니다.",
    "realUsageKo": "주로 두 가지 의미로 쓰입니다. 첫째, 한 말을 취소하거나 철회할 때 ('I take it back'), 둘째, 구매한 물건을 반품하거나 빌린 것을 돌려받을 때 사용합니다.",
    "etymologyKo": "'take'(가져가다)와 'back'(뒤로)의 결합으로, 무언가를 원래 있던 곳으로 되돌린다는 직관적인 의미에서 출발해 발언 철회의 비유적 의미로 확장되었습니다.",
    "nuanceKo": "말을 취소할 때 쓰면 진심으로 후회하는 뉘앙스가 강하며, 단순한 사과보다 자신의 발언 자체를 없었던 것으로 하고 싶다는 의지를 담고 있습니다. 일상 대화에서 매우 자주 쓰이는 자연스러운 표현입니다.",
    "shortExampleEn": "That was rude of me — I take it back.",
    "shortExampleKo": "내가 무례했어 — 그 말 취소할게."
