    "story": "Tom had worked at the company for three years without any issues, so when his sales numbers suddenly dropped, his supervisor decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Instead of immediately putting him on a performance plan, she scheduled a one-on-one meeting to understand what was going on. It turned out Tom had been quietly managing his mother's illness while trying to keep up with his workload. His supervisor was moved by his dedication and arranged for him to take some personal leave. When Tom returned, he was more focused than ever, and his numbers climbed back up within a month. The team learned that choosing to trust someone first can make all the difference.",
