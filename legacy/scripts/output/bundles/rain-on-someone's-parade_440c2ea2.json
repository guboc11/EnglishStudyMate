    "story": "After months of hard work, James finally got the promotion he had been dreaming about and rushed home to share the news with his family. His sister, however, rained on his parade almost immediately, pointing out that the new role came with a brutal travel schedule and long overtime hours. James felt the excitement drain out of him as he sat down and stared at the offer letter again. He wished she had at least let him enjoy the moment before raising concerns.
