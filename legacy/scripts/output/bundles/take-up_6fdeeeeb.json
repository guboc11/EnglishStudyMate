    "story": "Jina had always admired the rock climbers at the gym near her office, watching them scale the walls during her lunch breaks. One rainy Monday, feeling stuck in her routine, she walked in and signed up for a beginner class. She was terrified at first — her arms trembled and her palms were slick with sweat. But the instructor smiled and said everyone starts somewhere, and that was enough to keep her going. By the end of the month, she had taken up climbing as a serious hobby, spending every weekend at the crag. It didn't just take up her free time — it completely transformed the way she saw challenges in her everyday life.",
