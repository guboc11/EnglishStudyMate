Sitting by his bedside, he began to pass down everything he remembered, story by story, recipe by recipe. Hana recorded every word on her phone, afraid of losing even a single detail.

By the time spring arrived, Hana had filled three notebooks and felt a deep responsibility to continue sharing what she had received.",
