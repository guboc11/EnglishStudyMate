    "story": "Growing up in a small town, Lena always felt the pressure to blend in — to wear what others wore, study what others studied, and dream what others dreamed. But something inside her refused to settle. When she applied to art school instead of the local university everyone expected her to attend, her family was shocked. She knew it would be hard, but she had made up her mind to dare to be different, no matter the cost.
