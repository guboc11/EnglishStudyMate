One rainy weekend, he decided to dig up whatever he could find in the dusty boxes stored in the basement. Among faded letters and crumbling newspapers, he discovered a photograph of his great-grandfather standing in front of a small bakery in Seoul. He showed it to his mother, who burst into tears and shared stories she had kept to herself for years. That single photograph opened a door to conversations the family had avoided for decades. Marcus realized that sometimes the most meaningful truths are the ones you have to dig up yourself.",
