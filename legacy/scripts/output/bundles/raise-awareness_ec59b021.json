    "story": "The documentary had been made explicitly to raise awareness about deep-sea mining. It reached a large audience. The filmmakers tracked not just viewership but downstream impact — whether the audience had changed their behavior, contacted representatives, or engaged with related organizations. The numbers were humbling: awareness had increased measurably; behavior change had not. The experience reshaped how the filmmakers thought about their next project. Raising awareness was necessary but not sufficient. What happened after the awareness was raised mattered at least as much.",
