Every time the subject came up, she would pivot to complimenting the flowers or the music, carefully sidestepping her true feelings. Her friend, however, was sharp enough to notice the evasion and finally cornered her over coffee one afternoon. 'Just say it,' she said with a knowing smile. 'I know something bothered you.'

She finally spoke honestly, and to her relief, her friend laughed it off and thanked her for her candor.",
