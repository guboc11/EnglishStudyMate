Her dishes had become too complicated, too experimental, and her loyal customers had started drifting away. She went back to basics, revisiting the simple recipes her grandmother had taught her in a small village kitchen. She practiced knife skills, mastered stocks, and relearned how to balance flavors without relying on fancy techniques. When the restaurant reopened, the menu was half the size but twice as satisfying. The regulars returned, and for the first time in a year, Maria felt proud of every plate she sent out.",
