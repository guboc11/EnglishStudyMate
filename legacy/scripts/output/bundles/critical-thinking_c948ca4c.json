    "story": "The course had been redesigned with one explicit goal: to develop critical thinking skills rather than content knowledge. Students were evaluated not on what they knew but on how they reasoned — whether they identified assumptions, considered alternative explanations, and engaged honestly with evidence that contradicted their initial position. Faculty found the redesign uncomfortable because it required them to be genuinely uncertain in front of students. Students found it uncomfortable because it removed the option of giving a correct answer to avoid thinking. By the end of the semester, both groups reported it was the hardest and most useful course they had been part of.",
