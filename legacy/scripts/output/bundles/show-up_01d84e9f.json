    "story": "Mina had been planning her gallery opening for months, sending out dozens of invitations to friends, family, and local art critics. On the night of the event, she stood alone in the brightly lit room, surrounded by her paintings but no people. She kept glancing at the door, wondering if anyone would show up at all. Then, at half past seven, a small group of college students wandered in, their eyes wide with curiosity.
