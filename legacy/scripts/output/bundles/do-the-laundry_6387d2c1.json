    "story": "It was Sunday morning, and Jake's apartment smelled like fresh coffee. He stretched on the couch, enjoying the quiet, until he noticed the mountain of clothes spilling out of his bedroom closet. He knew he had to do the laundry today — his last clean shirt was the one he was wearing. He sorted the darks from the whites, measured out the detergent, and started the first load. While the machine hummed, he wiped down the kitchen counter and watered his plants. By the afternoon, neatly folded stacks of warm clothes lined his bed, and he felt a small but real sense of accomplishment.",
