    "story": "Marcus had spent three years building his startup from a spare bedroom, but growth had stalled and investors were losing patience. His mentor pulled him aside after a board meeting and told him bluntly that the problem wasn't funding or talent — it was that Marcus didn't have a clear vision for what success actually looked like.

By morning, he had distilled it into a single sentence that he could say without hesitation. At the next all-hands meeting, he shared that vision with the team, and for the first time, he saw genuine excitement in their eyes. The clarity changed everything — decisions became faster, priorities aligned, and the company began moving with purpose.",
