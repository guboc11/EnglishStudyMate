    "story": "Mia had always considered herself a patient person, but her new neighbor was testing that belief. Every night at eleven, he would start practicing drums in his apartment, the muffled thumping vibrating through her bedroom wall. She left polite notes, but nothing changed. It was getting on her nerves so badly that she started losing sleep and snapping at people at work. One evening she knocked on his door, ready for a confrontation, only to discover he was a teenager preparing for his first school concert. They worked out a practice schedule together, and the drumming never bothered her again.",
