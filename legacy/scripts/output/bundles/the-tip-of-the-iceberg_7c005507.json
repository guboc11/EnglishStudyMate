The footage was heartbreaking: blackened shorelines, fishing boats idle for the third month in a row, and a fishing community facing economic collapse. The director acknowledged in the closing segment that this village was the tip of the iceberg — that fourteen other communities along the coast faced similar or worse conditions, and that most of their stories had not been told. The film generated significant funding for environmental recovery. The director went back the following year and made four more films.",
