    "story": "Daniel had spent years as a science teacher in a small rural school, watching his students leave for bigger cities with little ambition to return. One afternoon, he brought in a local engineer to speak to the class — not expecting much, just hoping to plant a seed. The engineer talked about how she had grown up in a similar town, faced the same doubts, and still built something she was proud of. Daniel watched the students lean forward, eyes wide, asking questions they had never asked before. He didn't know which of them would act on it, or when, but he trusted that something had shifted. Some seeds take years to grow, he reminded himself — the planting still matters.",
