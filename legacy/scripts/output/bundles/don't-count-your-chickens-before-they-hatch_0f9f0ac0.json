    "story": "Lena had spent weeks studying for the medical school entrance exam, and when she walked out of the test hall, she felt certain she had aced it. She called her parents, booked a celebratory dinner, and started researching apartments near the campus. Her older sister, a doctor herself, listened patiently before saying, 'I'm proud of how hard you worked, but don't count your chickens before they hatch.'

She learned that hope and premature certainty were very different things, and that celebrating outcomes you haven't secured yet only makes failure more public.",

    "nuanceKo": "충고나 경고의 뉘앙스가 강하며, 가까운 사이에서 친근하게 쓰이기도 하지만 때로는 상대방의 들뜬 기대를 차갑게 식히는 냉정한 조언으로도 느껴질 수 있습니다.",
