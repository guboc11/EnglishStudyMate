On the morning of departure, he sat in the driveway for two minutes just gripping the steering wheel. Then he put the car in reverse and decided they were finally going to hit the road. The traffic out of the city was terrible and the first motel smelled like old carpet, but none of that mattered much once the highway opened up and the music played.",
