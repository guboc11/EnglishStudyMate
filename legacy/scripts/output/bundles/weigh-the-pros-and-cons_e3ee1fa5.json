    "story": "Elena had been offered a promotion that would double her salary but require her to travel three weeks out of every month. She sat down with a blank notebook and began to weigh the pros and cons with the same methodical care she applied to everything in her life.

Weighing the pros and cons had not given her the answer, but it had shown her what she valued most.",
