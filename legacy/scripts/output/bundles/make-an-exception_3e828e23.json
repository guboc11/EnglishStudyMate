    "story": "Jenna had been working at the library for over a decade, and she always enforced the two-week borrowing limit without fail. One afternoon, a high school student approached the desk looking desperate. He explained that his family couldn't afford to buy the textbook he needed for his final exams, and two weeks wouldn't be enough time. Jenna glanced at the worn book in his hands and felt something shift inside her. She decided to make an exception and extended his borrowing period to six weeks.
