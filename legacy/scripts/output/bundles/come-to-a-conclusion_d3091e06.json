    "story": "The philosophical question the seminar had been wrestling with for three weeks was whether it was possible to come to a conclusion about something inherently uncertain.

Another argued that the discomfort of unresolved questions was more honest than the false certainty of premature conclusions. The professor did not arbitrate. She let the tension remain, which was, she later noted in her teaching journal, the most productive thing a seminar could do.",
