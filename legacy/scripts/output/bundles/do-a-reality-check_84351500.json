    "story": "Elena had been planning her dream wedding for over a year, filling notebooks with ideas for a grand ballroom, a five-course dinner, and a live orchestra. When she and her fiancé finally sat down to look at their savings, her fiancé gently suggested they do a reality check. The numbers on the spreadsheet told a very different story from the one in her notebooks. They couldn't afford even half of what she had envisioned without going into serious debt. At first Elena felt deflated, but as they talked it through, she realized that a smaller, more intimate celebration could be just as meaningful. Doing that reality check turned out to be the best decision they made together before the wedding.",

    "etymologyKo": "'reality check'는 1990년대 영어권에서 널리 쓰이기 시작한 표현으로, 심리학적 개념인 '현실 검증(reality testing)'에서 유래했다. 'do a reality check'는 이를 일상 표현으로 굳힌 형태다.",
