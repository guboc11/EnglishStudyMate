    "story": "Soyeon had been a wedding photographer for over a decade, but she still got butterflies before every ceremony. Today's couple had been together since high school, and their families filled the small garden venue with loud laughter and happy tears.

She lived for chances like this — to capture a moment that people would look back on for the rest of their lives.
