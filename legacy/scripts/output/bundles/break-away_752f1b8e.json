    "story": "For as long as she could remember, Elena had lived under the shadow of her older sister—always compared, always falling short in her parents' eyes. Every career choice, every relationship, every small decision was scrutinized against what her sister had done first. The pressure built slowly, like water filling a sealed room. Then one autumn, Elena packed her bags and moved to a different city, determined to break away from the family dynamic that had defined her whole identity. She found a small apartment, a job she loved, and slowly began to discover who she actually was. It wasn't easy, and there were moments of loneliness, but she never once wished she hadn't done it.",
