    "story": "The game designer had been in the zone for six hours. She had told herself she would stop at noon, eat something, and go for a walk. At two-thirty she looked up from the screen and realized she had completely lost track of time again. She stretched, went to the kitchen, and found herself immediately thinking about the design problem she had just been solving.

The walk happened the next morning instead.",
