    "story": "Growing up in a small farming town, Jiwon watched her older siblings settle into predictable lives close to home. She loved her family, but something restless burned inside her. At eighteen, she told her parents she wanted to pursue success in the city and study international business. The first year in Seoul was brutal — she worked part-time at a convenience store while attending lectures during the day.
