The moment he let go, his legs wobbled and he fell over onto the cold ice. A little girl skated up to him and offered her hand with a big smile. Embarrassed but grateful, he took it and slowly got back on his feet. By the end of the afternoon, he could make it halfway around the rink without falling over once.",
