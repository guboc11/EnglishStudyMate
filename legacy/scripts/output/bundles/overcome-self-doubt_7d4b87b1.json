    "story": "Every time Lena sat down at the piano for her recital practice, her fingers would freeze. She had played this piece a hundred times in her room, but the thought of performing in front of others made her feel like a fraud. Her teacher noticed and told her that every great musician had to overcome self-doubt at some point — it was part of the journey, not a sign to stop.
