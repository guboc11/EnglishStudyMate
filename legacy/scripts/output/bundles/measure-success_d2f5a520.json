    "story": "Marcus had always measured success by the size of his paycheck, but a serious illness forced him to slow down and reconsider. Lying in a hospital bed, he thought about the relationships he had neglected and the experiences he had postponed. When he recovered, he decided to measure success differently — by the quality of his connections and the joy he found in everyday moments. He cut back his work hours, spent more time with his family, and started volunteering on weekends. By the time his annual review came around, his manager noticed something unexpected: his productivity had actually improved. Measuring success on his own terms had given Marcus a clarity and motivation he had never felt before.",
