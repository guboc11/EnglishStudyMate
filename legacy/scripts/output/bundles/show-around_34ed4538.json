    "story": "When my cousin visited Seoul for the first time, I took a whole week off work to show him around the city. We started with the bustling streets of Myeongdong, where the neon signs and street food stalls amazed him. I showed him around Gyeongbokgung Palace, explaining the history behind every gate and courtyard. On the last day, we wandered through the narrow alleys of Bukchon Hanok Village, and he said it was the highlight of his trip. He told me that having someone show him around made the experience completely different from traveling alone. I realized then that being a good guide is really about sharing the places you love with someone who matters.",
